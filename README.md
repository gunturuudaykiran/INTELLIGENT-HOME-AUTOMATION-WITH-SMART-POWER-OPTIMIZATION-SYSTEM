# INTELLIGENT-HOME-AUTOMATION-WITH-SMART-POWER-OPTIMIZATION-SYSTEM
The proposed Intelligent home automation with smart power optimization system to reduce the electricity bills
by continuously monitoring the home environment through the mobile application called telegram. We can
control our home appliances from anywhere with our mobile phone. The IOT system which is interfaced with
a controller and receives the commands from the smart phone. Based on received command the home
appliances will be turn ON/OFF automatically. It offers following features: Alexa, google assistance, web
server. efficient, and adaptable solution for managing household tasks and optimizing energy usage. Through
real-time data processing, remote connectivity, and integration with renewable energy sources. It plays a
crucial role in creating a more sustainable and comfortable living environment. As the day passes towards the future the technologies which are developing 
day-to-day in intelligent home automation has revolutionized the way households 
manage energy consumption and optimize power usage. Comprising 
microcontrollers, by employing DH11, thermistors, humidity, and gas sensors, and 
also calculate the current, voltage, and power from the energy meter to send an alerts 
to the owner through the IOT these are the backbone of the proposed solution
